        <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His equation E=mcÂ², which relates energy and mass, is one of the most famous equations in the world. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.</p>
        <p>He made significant contributions to various areas of physics, including quantum mechanics and cosmology. Einstein's work laid the foundation for much of our understanding of the universe.</p>
        <p>Throughout his life, Einstein advocated for peace, civil rights, and education. He left an enduring legacy as one of the most brilliant and influential scientists in history.</p>
